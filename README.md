# particle_integration

Usage regarding fdtd solver and interpolator:

1. Download the params.py, fields.pu, fields_diagnostics.py, interpolator.py and interpolator_diagnostics.py. Place them all in one folder.  

2. Change all user parameters in params.py

3. All the input parameters for the fdtd code can be changed in params.py

4. Use ghostcells = 1 only, for the current solver.

5. This is a work in progress code and new features and updates will be added on to it.
